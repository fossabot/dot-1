// Package dot provides interfaces and ready-to-use concrete types to create
// graphviz-compatible graphs using its dot language.
//
// This package was inspired/initially forked from github.com/emicklei/dot,
// but has too many breaking changes compared to the original - namely interface
// usage and other distinct design decisions - that it was decided to maintain
// separately. If you need a simpler, no-brainy option, use the original one.
